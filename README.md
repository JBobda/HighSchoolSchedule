# HighSchoolSchedule
A personal project to develop a schedule system for my high school.
Ultimately exists to increase familirarity with Object Oriented Programming concepts and to work on larger projects than the class usually demands. Currently Terminal based but in the future a graphical user interface, File IO and other features could be added to improve the application.
